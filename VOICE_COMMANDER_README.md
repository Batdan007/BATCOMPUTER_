## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Option 1: Automatic Installation (Recommended)

1. **Run the installer script:**

   python install_voice_deps.py
   ```

2. **Or install manually:**
   ```bash
   pip install pyaudio SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 gtts edge-tts pygame requests
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Installation

If you encounter issues with PyAudio on Windows:

1. **Install Visual C++ Build Tools** (if needed)
2. **Use pre-built wheel:**
   ```bash
   pip install pyaudio --only-binary=all
   ```

## üéØ Usage

### Starting the Voice Commander

1. **Using the batch file (Windows):**
   ```
   Double-click: BATCOMPUTER_Voice.bat
   ```

2. **Using Python directly:**
   ```bash
   python BATCOMPUTER_voice_commander.py
   ```

### Voice Commands

1. **Say the wake word:** "BATCOMPUTER"
2. **Wait for confirmation:** "Yes, Sir? I'm listening."
3. **Speak your command:** "What time is it?"
4. **Listen to response:** BATCOMPUTER will speak back

### Example Commands

- "Hello" - Greeting
- "What time is it?" - Current time
- "Test voice" - Voice system test
- "Exit" or "Goodbye" - Quit the system

## üîß Configuration

### Voice Settings

Edit the `voice_settings` in `BATCOMPUTER_voice_commander.py`:

```python
self.voice_settings = {
    "rate": 140,                    # Speech rate
    "volume": 0.9,                  # Volume level
    "wake_word": "BATCOMPUTER",     # Wake word
    "listen_timeout": 5,            # Wake word listen time
    "energy_threshold": 4000        # Microphone sensitivity
}
```

### TTS Engine Priority

The system tries TTS engines in this order:
1. **Microsoft Edge TTS** (free, high quality)
2. **Enhanced pyttsx3** (built-in, optimized)
3. **Google TTS** (British accent)

## üé§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No module named 'pyaudio'"**
   - Run: `python install_voice_deps.py`
   - Or: `pip install pyaudio --only-binary=all`

2. **Microphone not working**
   - Check Windows microphone permissions
   - Ensure microphone is set as default device
   - Test in Windows Sound settings

3. **Speech recognition not working**
   - Check internet connection
   - Try adjusting `energy_threshold` in settings
   - Speak clearly and at normal volume

4. **TTS not working**
   - The system will fall back to text mode
   - Check if any TTS engines are available

### Performance Tips

- **Lower `energy_threshold`** if wake word detection is too sensitive
- **Increase `listen_timeout`** if you need more time to say the wake word
- **Use Edge TTS** for best quality (free and reliable)
